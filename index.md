# Space_physics
This project will provide an opportunity to observe in real time physical phenomena described further and create your own simulations. Such physical phenomena as Newton's law of universal gravitation, the law of conservation of momentum are taken into account. Also, the project's features are the scalability of the simulation surface and free movement on it.

I am not yet able to take into account [General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity). Perhaps the speed of gravitational interaction will be used, which is theoretically equal to the speed of light. In the future, it is possible to branch in the form of using the [pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/) module to calculate collisions.

Active development is underway on the [test](https://github.com/bogtogus/Space_physics/tree/test) branch.
English is supported. I recommend using SQLite Studio to work with the database.
Write your suggestions or ideas, I will be grateful.
