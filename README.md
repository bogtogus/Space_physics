# Space_physics
Made with pygame. 
Active development is underway on the test branch.
Such physical phenomena as Newton's law of universal gravitation, the law of conservation of momentum, merging of objects will be taken into account. 
In the future, it is possible to brunch in the form of using the [pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/) module.
