# Space_physics
###### Made with pygame. 
This project will provide an opportunity to observe physical phenomena described below and create your own simulations. 
Active development is underway on the [test](https://github.com/bogtogus/Space_physics/tree/test) branch.
Such physical phenomena as Newton's law of universal gravitation, the law of conservation of momentum, merging of objects will be taken into account. 
In the future, it is possible to branch in the form of using the [pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/) module.

English is supported. At the moment, the screen resolution of 1920x1080 is stable. I recommend using SQLite Studio to work with the database.

Write your suggestions or ideas, I will be grateful.
